This is a small app for online reservation of beer. It is here only to show sample of my coding.

Description:
First, from list of breuwers, you chose one. Then, you choose a beer from his list of beers. 
Then, you see all relevant data and input number of bottles you wish to reserve. 
At this point, you have your basket with items you added. The sum for payment is calculated automathically. 
You can then continue the purchase via menu or you can procede to reservation screen. 
On reservation screen you input your data, and if everything is ok, system notifies you that reservation went ok.

Technical description:
- You need MySql database installed.
- Script for database called "beerhuis" is not inlcuded here to prevent further distribution. 
If something changes in this area, I will announce it here. 
- ORM mapping is done via JPA, although I have one more version of the same app that is done via JDBC

Thanks.
